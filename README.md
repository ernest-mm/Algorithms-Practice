A personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions written while practicing on various competitive programming and algorithm platforms.

The repository organizes solutions by source/platform to make them easy to find and run.

## Repository layout

- `CodeChef/` — Solutions submitted to CodeChef.
- `CSES/` — Solutions from the CSES Problem Set.
- `LeetCode/` — LeetCode solutions.

Each folder contains one file per problem. Filenames typically include the problem number and a short descriptive title, for example `1-Two-Sum.py` or `Permutations.c`.
